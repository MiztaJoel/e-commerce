Creating Empty Controller(withoutEntity)
create a model class cart.cs 
inside the model, I call the instance of Product as Product and int as quantity.
then, i write a public construct function that is used to updated product and quantity.

View: emptity view was created without no model

OrderingNow ActionName: fistly check if session name cart is null, then list the product which is equal to  
query id and initialize the quantity to be 1 then save the list inside cart session.
but if the session is not null then, convert every items to List of Cart class, then add it new instance of
cart that will return all the product that is equal to query id and initalize quantity to 1.
